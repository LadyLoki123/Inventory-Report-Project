The Inventory Report project was a problem given in a Structured Programming course. It was to be solved using conventions taught in class, as well as several hints toward approach methods, but every line
of code was to be created independently by students. This project is my solution to the problem given below.

An inventory company, Ivanâ€™s Inventive Inventory Incorporated wants a program to organize the data pertaining to each item they have in inventory. They want the program to output various reports including:
A report showing all of the items they carry along with a summary of the potential profit and the total value of their inventory.
A report of items that have a particular letter in its ID
A report of items that have a quantity below a particular level

The main objectives were to demonstrate proficiency in these areas:

Inputting, outputting and processing an array of structures
Sorting elements of an array of structures
Safeguarding against an index out of bounds error when using arrays
Reusing functions which differ only slightly in functionality
Implementating functions inside a program to achieve modularity and to make the main function into a driver
Using of priming reads for a loop correctly
Properly desk checing results by producing output that is 100% accurate

Thank you for checking out my project. If you plan to download and test my solution, please rename the input and output files by deleting the descriptions int the parentheses, as well as any extra spaces. 
Make sure to place all the files into the same folder. These instructions ensure the files will be accessible by your programming software when you run the program.
